# Forgerock Parent - Community Edition

This repository contains the code used to build the forgerock-parent.jar used by the OpenAM, OpenDJ, OpenIDM and OpenIG Community edition projects.

## About

There are four branches each containing the code used to create the community tags (ce/1.0.0, ce/1.1.0, ce/1.2.0 & ce/1.2.1). There are no jar files associated with the releases as all the Community Edition binary artifacts are made available via ForgeRock's [Maven Community Repository](http://maven.forgerock.org/repo/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/community).
